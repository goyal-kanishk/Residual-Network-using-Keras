# Residual-Network-using-Keras
This repo will show you how to build a very deep ResNet using Keras.
Very deep NNvoften encounter the problem of vanishing or exploding gradients.
Residual Networks or ResNet are a very good method to avoid that problem.
Here I have used a ResNet to build a %0 layer deep CNN, for image classification on SIGNS dataset.
Keras is an API capable of running on top of tensorflow.
